I am a Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Ben Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). I am supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. My research is on computer vision and natural language processing, especially the intersection between video and language.

Before Johns Hopkins, I got my B.S. from the University of Rochester advised by [Dr. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/) and [Dr. Aaron Steven White](https://aaronstevenwhite.io/).
