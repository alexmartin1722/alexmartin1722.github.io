I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Ben Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing and computer vision, especially towards advancing end-to-end AI assisted article writing and reasoning using multimodal content. The core of my current research focuses on generating text (articles) that are grounded against both text and videos. I have published on:
- Retrieving information from videos in [multilingual real-world settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11619) by [efficient retrieval models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19009v1).
- Grounding information in [cross-document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05601) and [video-text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05267) settings.
- Writing articles from [multiple videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00939), [document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06973), and [cross-document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14795)


Before Johns Hopkins, I got my B.S. from the University of Rochester advised by [Dr. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/) and [Dr. Aaron Steven White](https://aaronstevenwhite.io/).
