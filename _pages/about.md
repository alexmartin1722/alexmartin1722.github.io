I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Dr. Ben Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, especially towards advancing end-to-end AI assisted report wrtining using multimodal content. I am supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) on this topic.

My research focuses mainly on the intersection videos and language, where I work to improve how models find, understand, ground, and generate information. My current directions fall in 3 main categories all centered around AI-assisted report wrtining using multimodal content:
- Retrieving information from videos in [multilingual realworld settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11619) by improving retrieval models.
- Grounding information in [cross-document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05601) and [video-text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05267) settings.
- Summarizing information at the [document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06973), [cross-document](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14795), and video levels. 


Before Johns Hopkins, I got my B.S. from the University of Rochester advised by [Dr. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/) and [Dr. Aaron Steven White](https://aaronstevenwhite.io/).
